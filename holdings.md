# Holdings

ARM Holdings, the company behind the ARM Architecture and much more.

## Business model

Licensing.

Products: <http://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/08/how-arm-licenses-its-ip-for-production/>

I think it licenses both designs, but also allowing people to implement the ISA itself, which some big companies do, e.g. Qualcomm Krait <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krait_(CPU)> for Snapdragon.

## Founding

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Holdings#History

Joint venture of:

- Apple
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers which was split up at IPO time
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLSI_Technology

## Success

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLSI_Technology>

> ARM Ltd was formed in 1990 as a semiconductor intellectual property licensor, backed by Acorn, Apple and VLSI. VLSI became a licensee of the powerful ARM processor and ARM finally funded processor tools. Initial adoption of the ARM processor was slow. Few applications could justify the overhead of an embedded 32-bit processor. In fact, despite the addition of further licensees, the ARM processor enjoyed little market success until they developed the novel 'thumb' extensions. Ericsson adopted the ARM processor in a VLSI chipset for its GSM handset designs in the early 1990s. It was the GSM boost that is the foundation of ARM the company/technology that it is today.

Thumb extensions: most important instructions would fit in 16 bits: <https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2001/cmsc411/proj01/arm/thumb.html> Apparently licensed from Hitachi: <https://youtu.be/lZGHbMS882w?t=620>

## Intel

Owned ARM chips through XScale, but gave up on them at the key iPhone moment after many previous failures: <http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/19/how-intel-lost-the-mobile-chip-business-to-apples-ax-arm-application-processors>

Apple approached them but they did not believe the iPhone.

## Locations

US largest locations: San Jose (local center) and Austin, both 300 engineers.

### Cambridge

1200 people.

### Sheffield

Infinite Designs is a 2000 acquisition from there, are the offices still the same? No Different address.

<http://ir.arm.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197211&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=831292> says it was mainly to expand geographically:

Continuation of the Infinite Design acquisition:

> Acquisitions Two acquisitions were completed in the first half of the year: the first was Infinite Designs Limited, a nine person design services company in Sheffield, UK. The second was EuroMIPS Systems SAS, a fourteen person design house based in Sophia Antipolis, France. In both cases the primary objective was to establish a base for further expansion into different geographical markets where valuable engineering skills are present. Our establishment of a presence in Sheffield has already begun to bear fruit with half a dozen new recruits within a few months. Our acquisition of EuroMIPS Systems SAS represents an important development to help us better penetrate the market for 'secure' cores used in smart cards and other forms of e-commerce. We plan to increase the size of both of these new offices significantly

Richard Meacham from Infinite is still at ARM, but now in the US: https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardmeacham?authType=name&authToken=IyS0&locale=en_US&srchid=1851484281465416086573&srchindex=2&srchtotal=2194&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId:1851484281465416086573,VSRPtargetId:15681735,VSRPcmpt:primary,VSRPnm:false,authType:name

Jørn Nystad, Mario Blazevic, Edvard Sørgård and Borgar Ljosland are mentioned at http://www.digi.no/artikler/arm-kjoper-norsk-teknologiselskap/280866 They are centered at: NTNU https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology

### Open source

- the kernel side source or part of it was released under the GPL:
    - http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/open-source-mali-utgard-gpu-linux-kernel-drivers/
    - http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/previous-releases/open-source-mali-gpus-linux-kernel-device-drivers-previous-releases/
- Phoronix says the driver cannot be accepted into the kernel mainline without an open userspace to support it, as it cannot be used directly without that: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTY3OTM
