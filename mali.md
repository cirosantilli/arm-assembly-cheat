## Open source

-   Binary userspace driver blobs and kernel driver source for free download from: <http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/>
-   the kernel side source or part of it was released under the GPL:
    - http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/open-source-mali-utgard-gpu-linux-kernel-drivers/
    - http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/previous-releases/open-source-mali-gpus-linux-kernel-device-drivers-previous-releases/
-   Phoronix says the driver cannot be accepted into the kernel mainline without an open userspace to support it, as it cannot be used directly without that: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTY3OTM
-   the userland part of the driver is available only as binary blobs at: http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/arm-mali-midgard-gpu-user-space-drivers/
-   examples on the SDK: <http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/sdks/opengl-es-sdk-for-linux/> Also has emulator libraries to run without the GPU. TODO: emulator means software renderer? Possibly it is: <http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/tools/opengl-es-emulator/> which implements OpenGL ES with OpenGL.
